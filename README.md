# NotesBlues
NotesBlues is an Express/Angular project that provides a REST API and frontend board for managing notes. The project takes inspiration from the blues music genre to bring a soulful and expressive feel to note-taking.

## REST API
The NotesBlues REST API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. Here are the available endpoints:

- GET /notes: Retrieves all notes
- POST /notes: Creates a new note
- GET /notes/:id: Retrieves a specific note by ID
- PUT /notes/:id: Updates a specific note by ID
- DELETE /notes/:id: Deletes a specific note by ID
- Each note object contains a title, body, and tags property. Tags can be used to categorize and filter notes.

## Frontend
The NotesBlues frontend provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and deleting notes. The design takes inspiration from blues album covers, using bold typography and vintage color schemes.

- Users can view all their notes in a grid layout. Clicking on a note opens up a modal where users can edit the note's title, body, and tags. - - Users can also delete notes directly from the grid view.
